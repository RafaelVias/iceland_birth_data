# Icelandic birthrate data

This repository contains two datasets on birthrates in Iceland.

The first dataset (daily_births.csv) shows the number of daily births in Iceland from 01-01-1990 to 31-12-2021. 
This datset was gotten by a special request to Statistics Iceland [https://statice.is/].

The second dataset (caesarian.csv) shows the yearly number of births in Iceland by type (normal vs. caesarian) from 1970-2020.
This data was gathered in Fæðingarkrá, kvennadeild LHS (The National University Hospital of Iceland).
This dataset was downloaded as two separate datasets and merged together. 
The data for 1970-1981 comes from the webpage of the Icelandic Parliament [https://www.althingi.is/altext/128/s/0397.html].
The data for 1982-2020 was originally gotten from the webpage of the Icelandic Directorate of Health, but can now only (to my knowledge) be found at through this link [https://assets.ctfassets.net/8k0h54kbe6bj/2st9VKp7yeargOJpCyRejc/1293c4dd46886c08d44862625d5a3f94/keisarar1982_2020.xls].
